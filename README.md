#Trello Clone on Mongoose and Angular

**NOTE: This app is created purely for academic purposes.

##Description

Trello Clone first started as a simple todo-list app that many new developers are familiar with. This app allows the user to create a board and multiple lists of todo-items within the board. The user may also invite a member (another user) to the board he/she created and let the member have access to the contents of the board. Once user has access to the board, he/she is free to make how many board/lists/todo items as he/she pleases.

##How To Run App
